```

### Debug a Session
```bash
# For V1 contract sessions
npx hardhat run scripts/debug/debug-rps-session.js --network somnia

# For V2 contract sessions
npx hardhat run scripts/debug/debug-rps-v2-session.js --network somnia

## üìù Script Configuration

Most scripts use these default configurations:
- **V1 Contract**: `0x38e4C113767fC478B17b15Cee015ab8452f28F93`
- **V2 Contract**: `0xaD114670d92588036240849b36A95FE4d10Ad08F`
- **Network**: Somnia Testnet (`somnia`)

To modify session IDs or wallet addresses, edit the variables at the top of each script.

## üîß Contract Versions

- **V1 (Manual Withdrawal)**: Players must manually call `withdraw()` to claim prizes
- **V2 (Auto-Withdrawal)**: Prizes automatically transfer to winners upon game completion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always verify contract addresses before running scripts
- V2 auto-withdrawal requires session to be completed (both players revealed or deadline passed)
- Use force resolve only after reveal deadlines have passed
